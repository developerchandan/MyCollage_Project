<p><img src="images/shots/34ed7ef1776be8febff79e9523874a60.jpeg" height="461" width="795"/></p>


<p>Next:  Add a title to the layout and select a sample layout to get started. We've created some sample layouts to get you started quickly. Select any that you like and get started. </p>

<p><img src="images/shots/1ef2d4996d7a2c077ab54e6094f86d5b.jpeg" height="558" width="1112"/></p>

<p>Once you've selected the starting point, click <b>Add New Layout</b> and one will be created for you. This will move to the next edit screen where you can now edit the layout as you see fit using a drag and drop interface.</p>

<p>The builder page is divider into two sections. The top section is the featured area which is shown above the content area when on the front end. The second section is the main content area.</p>

<p><img src="images/shots/ffad24daf8524ac394022de647677aea.jpeg" height="457" width="1358"/></p>


<p>The featured area is typically used for sliders, slogans or call to action.</p>
<p><img src="images/shots/91bdab3b3c9f45c5649d504278aa9286.jpeg" height="232" width="475"/></p>

<p>The main content area 1240px wide also horizontally centered.</p>

<h4><b style="font-size: 24px;">Adding Elements</b></h4>
<p>Once on the builder editor page shown above, you can add any modules (also called elements) you need and drag and drop them about to reorganize. You can also drag an element from the featured area into the main content area and vise versa.</p>

<p>To add a element, select one from the Manage Modules select box. </p>
<p><img src="images/shots/11dd2dbf987d2859da4ad89d5dcfa158.jpeg" height="456" width="1019"/></p>


<p>The options available are:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Content Carousel</li>
<li>Content Carousel Big</li>
<li>Content Grid Slider - a grid slider that shows either featured, latest or category posts</li>
<li>Content Slider - a simpler slider</li>
<li>Content - This pulls content form the page where the layout is being used, from another page or from content entered into the module itself</li>
<li>Blog - For displaying blog content</li>
<li>Blog Category Small</li>
<li>Blog Latest - Tabbed element that will display Latest, Popular and Featured.</li>
<li>Blog Reviews - For displaying review posts</li>
<li>Divider</li>
<li>Widget area - you can add widget area in the middle of a page for example. You can create new widget area using the widget area manager</li>
<li>Video Central - show featured, latest videos</li>
<li>Contact Form - also available if form builder plugin is activated</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each elements contains its own set of options most of which are self explanatory.</p>

<div class="alert note">The elements available for use may vary depending on which plugin you have activated.</div>

<p><img src="images/shots/f05461f1ad415dcf0ebee7f51e3de9e1.jpeg" height="926" width="1342"/></p>

<p>Once you've added the elements you need on the page, you now drag them about and adjust their widths as needed. Remember to click <b>Update Layout</b> to save it. </p>
<p><img src="images/shots/e372b4f9b3e3355fd7871344812032af.jpeg" height="653" width="1488"/></p>

<h4>Styling Rows and elements</h4>
<p>In this new version of the framework, we've added a neat new capability that allows you to style element and row styles. Here is how to use it.</p>
<p><img src="images/shots/layout-builder-style-row.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here is some of the options available. <img src="images/shots/layout-builder-style-row-options.png" alt="" /></p>


<h4>Assigning the Layout to a page</h4>
<p>Once you have your layout ready, the next step is to add it to a page. Go to Page -> Add new and create a page. In page Attributes under Templates, select Custom Layout and then select one of the layout you created in the select box that appears. Save the page and view it in the frontend to see your changes</p>

<p><img src="images/shots/3378bee8ef8c3e060df047411bd39dda.jpeg" height="650" width="1066"/></p>

<p>To delete a layout go to its edit screen and click delete and confirm the dialog box that popup up. </p>

<div class="alert note">Note: A Layout can be reused on many pages at the same time.</div>


<h3 id="pages"><span class="number">6</span>Page Creation</h3>
<p>Creating your own page has been never so easy. To make the first step please go to Pages > Add new enter the page title and publish the page. At the bottom of the page editor are a few setting options. These are for setting up the sidebar location and the page subtitle.    </p>
<p><img src="images/shots/00d88397a54911098a562bb104f439aa.jpeg" height="219" width="643"/></p>
<p>Another important setting to note that will be useful when using page template is located on the right called the Page attributes, specifically the Template selector This is used to set the page template to be used.</p>
<p><img src="images/shots/aa641ca0dab92b6c9bcfdc7508bfc57f.jpeg" height="426" width="520"/></p>

<h3><span class="number">7</span>Page Templates</h3>
<p>Page templates are a clever way of creating a preconfigured page layout. We've included a few of these. All you need to do to use one is create a page, and in page attributes select the one you need. </p>

<p><img src="images/shots/aa641ca0dab92b6c9bcfdc7508bfc57f.jpeg" height="426" width="520"/></p>

<p>The available page templates are:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Blog Archive</li>
<li>Home - This supports 2 sidebars and the layout builder</li>
<li>Custom Layout - used by the layout builder and can have </li>
<li>Video Home</li>
<li>Video List</li>
<li>BBpress Page templates</li>
<li>Buddy Press Page Templates</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The blog archive page template has its own set of settings for adjusting things like number of columns, number of items to show etc.</p>


<h3 id="theme-options"><span class="number">8</span>Theme options panel</h3>
<p>Now we will cover the theme options panel. The theme options are used to store theme settings such as the logo, theme skins, theme layout, etc</p>

<p>The theme options panel is located under Appearance - > theme options </p>

<p><img src="images/shots/367277eda51ab2bf2ca2554d80b9041d.jpeg" height="1012" width="1166"/></p>

<p>The theme options panel is mostly self explanatory. </p>

<p>You can export/or import theme settings using the Import/export/reset tab.</p>

<h3 id="shortcodes"><span class="number">9</span>Shortcodes</h3>
<p>We understand that shortcodes can be daunting and intimidating to many that is why we've included an easy to use shortcode manager in addition to the layout builder we mentioned earlier. </p>

<h4>Adding a shortcode in content</h4>
<p>You can add a short code to a page by clicking the short codes icon in the editor this will show a drop down of all the available short codes</p>
<p><img src="images/shots/8fca58da18991fdba5a210960b7f4b43.jpeg" height="247" width="412"/></p>


<p>Once you select the short code you need, a popup will appear where you can input all the settings you need to make it work.</p>

<p><img src="images/shots/ece80d56a6fb43d3865cfb6bea6347ed.jpeg" height="756" width="855"/></p>

<p>You can also use shortcodes in the layout builder elements if you need to. Just generate the code using the method above and copy them over into the element.</p>


<h3 id="blog"><span class="number">10</span>Setting up the Blog</h3>
<h4>Creating your Blog Page</h4>

<p>Create a new page within the “Pages” > “Add New” menu, with the “Default” Template applied. Name and publish the page. From within your dashboard, navigate to the “Settings” panel and click on “Reading.” From the corresponding “Posts Page” drop down, choose the page that you just created (that has the Default Template applied). Ensure that you save your changes.</p>

<p><img src="images/shots/d5946ba7a82679164c899ce614301190.jpeg" height="204" width="574"/></p>

<p>Alternatively, You can use the Blog page template and skip the steps above.</p>

<h4>Adding a Blog Post</h4>

<p>From within your WordPress dashboard navigate to the Posts tab along the side bar and click “Add New.” To add a custom excerpt, ensure the excerpt checkbox within the screen option is checked. (Top right of the blog page, near the Admin Bar)</p>

<h4>Uploading Images</h4>

<p>To upload an image, click on the default “Upload/Insert Media” icon at the top of the WordPress editor. The recommend width of the blog images is 1000 pixels.</p>

<h4>Blog Featured Images</h4>

<p>To upload a featured image, locate the Featured Image Panel on the post editor page and click “Set Featured Image.”</p>

<h4>Blog Post Formats</h4>
<p>The theme supports various post formats:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>audio</li>
<li>gallery</li>
<li>video</li>
<li>standard</li>
<li>quote</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Some of these once selected will reveal some settings that need to be input for them to work properly.</p>


<h3 id="woocommerce"><span class="number">11</span>Woocommerce</h3>
<p>NewsCore supports woocommerce and once the plugin is activated, it will prompt you to automatically create the shop pages for you. This is useful since you might need to add shop pages to your custom menus.</p>

<p>By default, WooCommerce will display all of your products in the shop catalog. If you want to display the shop categories with the category images rather than all of the products like the theme demo you can change the catalog settings, "WooCommerce > Settings > Catalog".</p>

<h4>WooCommerce Image Options</h4>
<p>You need to make sure the default WooCommerce image sizes are the correct ones for your newly installed theme. These settings affect the actual dimensions of your product images in the shop pages.
<ul>
<li>Navigate from your WordPress Dashboard to WooCommerce → Settings → Catalog and find the "Image Options" section at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>Update those values with the following ones:</li>
<li>Catalog Images: Width = 230, Height = 300</li>
<li>Single Product Image: Width = 500, Height = 500</li>
<li>Product Thumbnails: Width = 200, Height = 200</li>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h6>Installing on a site with existing content?</h6>
<p>
If you are not installing the theme on a fresh WordPress instance, you probably already have posts, pages or products added to your site. After activating the theme, you'll need to have WordPress recreate all image thumbnails to make the sizes fit with your new theme. You don't need to do it manually, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> WP plugin can automatically handle this job for you.</p>

<h3 id="menus"><span class="number">12</span>Menu creation</h3>

<p>The theme is packaged with two WordPress Menu locations, the Main Menu and a Footer Menu. </p>

<p>The Main Menu is located at the top and supports megamenus. Megamenu drop-downs support multiple columns and can have images and/or html. The footer is located, well, in the footer.</p>

<p>To set these locations, simply create two menus in the WordPress Menu Dashboard "Dashboard/Appearance/Menu/Add New" and set the theme locations for "Main Menu" and "Footer Menu" on the menus page (top left).</p>


<h4>Mega Menu</h4>

<p>The Mega Menus in NewsCore can handle up to four columns of data. To set up a menu, click the "Use as Mega Menu" check box on the menu item and list out drop down menu items below it. See the image below to see how the first column of the demo mega menu is set up. Simple enough.</p>

<p><img src="images/shots/fa10d889dae82a26f8f0cf432848144c.jpeg" height="944" width="502"/></p>

<p>How a Mega Menu is set up (with a text description entry).</p>

<p><img src="images/shots/155dccc71ed66c2dceef53f8be034b42.jpeg" height="809" width="563"/></p>

<h4>Menu Icons</h4>

<p>To use icons in the menu all you need to do is add an icon class to the menu icon field. The theme uses the font awesome icon fonts. You can see a full list of available fonts here <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/" target="_blank">http://fontawesome.io/icons/</a>. To use an icon from that list change the icon prefix from fa- to icon- eg 
 fa-home becomes icon-home. </p>
<p><img src="images/shots/menu-icons.png" height="809" width="563"/></p>

<p>To hide the menu title and just show the icon, add an underscore before the Navigation label.</p>

<h3 id="widgets"><span class="number">13</span>Widgets &amp; Sidebars</h3>
<h4>Widget Area Overview</h4>

<p>There are 9 custom widgets built straight into the theme. Just select the one you would like use from the widget dashboard and put it into one of the default widget areas (or one that you added yourself).</p>

<p>On most of the theme's pages (default templates, blog, team and FAQ) you have the option to choose whether or not you would like a sidebar present and the location of that sidebar (left or right). Just select the location of the sidebar (located beneath the WordPress Editor) and save it. If you have not set a new sidebar for that page, the default sidebar will take over.</p>


<h4>Selecting your sidebar location.</h4>
<p><img src="images/shots/b98da90a29100c5d6d12b91810f6cb81.jpeg" height="219" width="643"/></p>

<h3 id="sidebars"><span class="number">14</span>Sidebar How To</h3>
<p>You can easily build an unlimited number of sidebars to use on whatever pages you'd like. You could even have a different sidebar on every page if you'd like. All you need to do is:
<ul>

<li>Go to Widgets/Sidebar Widget Areas</li>
<li>Name your widget area and define the rules (display location)</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p><img src="images/shots/5af12ca1d8c2fb2c10515d8313f94864.jpeg" height="590" width="569"/></p>

<p>Go to Pages -> Add New to create a new page.</p>
<p>Insert the contact form shortcode into the text editor e.g. [contact email="youremail@address.com"].

<h3 id="video-central"><span class="number">16</span>Video Central</h3>

<h4>Installing Video Central</h4>

<p>The plugin is included in the theme package. Extract it and install it into WordPress.</p>

<li>If you select a self hosted video, you will need to upload the video in 3 file
formats, mp4, webm, and ogg. This ensures that the videos plays across the maximum number of devices.</li>
<li>In the case of self hosted video, you will need to upload a video poster otherwise one will be imported automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>Select the parameters you need to import the videos</p>
<p>Import the videos</p>

<h4>Add a video Homepage</h4>

<h3 id="bp"><span class="number">17</span> BuddyPress / BBPress</h3>

<h4 id="installing-buddypress">Installing BuddyPress</h4>

<p>Before you begin please keep in mind that buddypress is faily large and complex plugin. Please take the time to read more on it on <a href="https://buddypress.org/">https://buddypress.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Go to Plugins -> Add and type "BuddyPress" and install and activate the plugin called BuddyPress.
The BuddyPress settings are located on the left hand side of the page under BuddyPress -> Settings.</p>

<h4 id="installing-bbpress">Installing bbPress</h4>

<p>bbPress now comes preinstalled with BuddyPress.
Go to Settings -> Forums and in the Archive Slugs and Single Slugs sections make sure there are no Possible BuddyPress conflict error messages.
If there are you will need to change the name of the bbPress slugs or the slugs of the conflicting pages.</p>
<div class="alert note">Although this theme was designed to work with BuddyPress and bbPress out of the box, I did not create either of these plugins and have no advanced knowledge about them. Unfortunately due to the huge amount of support questions
I have to answer each day regarding my own themes I cannot really spend time answering questions about external plugins unless there is a conflict with the theme in some way (in which case I will offer a bug fix).
You should direct any general BuddyPress or bbPress related questions to BuddyPress Support or bbPress Support.</div>

<li>Locate wp-config.php, which is in the root directory of your WordPress installation and change the language, click <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language#Manually_Installing_Language_Files">here</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Updating Your Translation Files</h4>
<p>If you have updated the theme and the changelog says the translation files have been updated, if you have modified the translation files or created new ones you will want to update them rather than using the new ones.
To do this insert your modified translation file (e.g. en_EN.po) into the newscore/includes/languages/ folder overwriting the new file.
Now open this file in PoEdit and click Update and it will display the text changes since the latest theme update.</p>



<h3 id="customization"><span class="number">19</span>Customization</h3>

<p>Customization is encouraged when using this theme. We have provided a few ways
to help you change things like the colors and layout. You may need to go beyond just the colors however and in this case
we recommend that you use the child theme provided in the "Extras" folder of the
theme package to customize your site.</p>

<p>This theme's stylesheets, javascript and language files are managed by grunt. The stylesheets are written in SCSS. We have automated generation of
css files, sprites, language files using this powerful utility. There are two main tasks that you can use.

<ul><li><code>grunt build</code> - This will generate css files, verify, compress and combine javascript files. Once compilation is complete <code>grunt watch</code> will monitor the files for any new changes and compile the files automatically.</li>
<li><code>grunt build-commit</code> - This will generate the images sprites and scan php files and generate .po/.mo files for language translation. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The theme makes extensive use of WordPress actions and filters on almost all
functions. This makes customization and overriding features very easy.

<h4>Developer Tools</h4>
<p>An excellent way of styling your theme is by using the developer tools that come
with most modern browsers.
These developers tools allow you to see what HTML elements need to be styled and allows
you to edit the styling of the theme within the browser window.
These changes are not permanent and nobody else sees them, it's just a great way of
adjusting the look of your site quickly. Here are some links to the developer tools for each of the major browsers:</p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome - <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/elements-styles">Inspect Element Tool</a></li>
<li>Firefox - <a href="http://www.tutorial9.net/tutorials/web-tutorials/quick-easy-css-development-with-firebug/">Firebug Tool</a></li>
<li>Internet Explorer 9 - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg589507(v=vs.85).aspx">F12 Developer Tools</a></li>
